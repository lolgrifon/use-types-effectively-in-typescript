/**
 * NOTE: I haven't implemented what is seen in the course here. Instead I have added different functionality for practice purposes.
 * Functionality added: 
 * - Differentiate between super heroes and super villain (separate interfaces that extend a common interface ComicCharacter)
 * - Create isEvil property that can only be set to true for super villains and can only be set to false for super heroes
 * - Added goodDeeds property to track super heroes goodDeeds
 * - Added badDeeds property to track super villains badDeeds
