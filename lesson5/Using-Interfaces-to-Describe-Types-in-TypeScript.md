We can use type checking to describe the shape of a value. If we want another value to have the same shape, we could copy paste. But already there's a parameter name problem. superHeroName doesn't make sense for a superVillain.

demo.ts

```typescript
let superHero: { secretIdentity: string; superHeroName: string; health: number };
let superVillain: { secretIdentity: string; superHeroName: string; health: number };
```

Sure, I could update both of them, but now I got to keep track of two variable shapes that are identical. The chance of making typos and errors increases. So let's make an interface and update the variables with the ComicBookCharacter type.

demo.ts

```typescript
interface ComicBookCharacter {
  secretIdentity?: string;
  alias: string;
  health: number;
}

let superHero: ComicBookCharacter;
let superVillain: ComicBookCharacter;

```

Some ComicBookCharacter identities are known, so let's add an optional parameter. Interfaces only describe the shape of the value. We still need to set some values. If there is a typo or error, both the IDE and compiler will catch it.

demo.ts

```typescript
let superHero: ComicBookCharacter = {
  alias: true,      // Types of property 'alias' are incompatable.
  health: 5000      // Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string'.
}
let superVillain: ComicBookCharacter = {
  secretIdentity: "Jack Napier", // Object literal may only specify known 
  alias: "Joker",               // properties and 'secretIdentity' does not 
  health: 75                    // exist in type 'ComicBookCharacter'
}
```

Types of property 'alias' are incompatible. Type boolean, which is what we've set our superhero to have, is not assignable to type string, which is what the ComicBookCharacter type should be. Object literal may only specify known properties and 'secretIdentity' identity does not exist in the ComicBookCharacter type.

When we create a function, we can type the argument with the interface. If we remove the type from the superHero and call the function, the IDE and compiler will still catch the errors. These are the same errors as before.

demo.ts

```typescript

let superHero = {
  alias: true,
  health: 5000
};

function getSecretIdentity(character: ComicBookCharacter) {
  if (character.secretIdentity) {
    console.log(`${character.alias} is ${character.secretIdentity}`);
  } else {
    console.log(`${character.alias} has no secret identity`);
  }
}
getSecretIdentity(superHero);  // Object literal may only specify known properties, and 
                               // 'scretIdentity' does not exist in type 'ComicBookCharacter'
```
Object literal may only specify known properties. 'secretIdentity' does not exist on the ComicBookCharacter type. Again, we're talking about the superVillain -- line 13, line 26, 19.

This time we're talking about the function because we still have the type on the argument being passed to the function. Types of property 'alias' are incompatible. Type 'boolean' is not assignable to type 'string'. Boolean not assignable type string.

Our characters need an attack method. We could add it to the ComicBookCharacter interface, but we might want someone who's not a ComicBookCharacter to be able to attack. So let's create an interface for a function.

demo.js
```typescript

interface AttackFunction {
  (opponent: { alias: string; health: number; }, attackWith: number): number;
}
```

Notice the opponent inline type. Inlining the type is still an interface. It just doesn't have a name that can be referenced. We need these specific params if KrustyTheClown wants to throw down. Notice how we're typing an interface param with an interface.

demo.js

```typescript

interface KrustyTheClown {
  alias: string;
  health: number;
  inebriationLevel: number;
  attack: AttackFunction;
}

```

Now let's add the attack function type as a parameter of a ComicBookCharacter interface. We can roll a reusable attack function and then add attack with params and the attack function for our characters.

demo.ts

```typescript

interface ComicBookCharacter {
  secretIdentity?: string;
  alias: string;
  health: number;
  attack: AttackFunction;
}
function attackFunc(opponent, attackWith) {
  opponent.health -= attackWith;
  console.log(`${this.alias} attacked ${opponent.alias}, who's health = ${opponent.health}`);
  return opponent.health;
}
let superHero: ComicBookCharacter = {
  alias: true,      
  health: 5000,
  strength: 5000,
  attack: attackFunc      
}
let superVillain: ComicBookCharacter = {
  scretIdentity: "Jack Napier", 
  alias: "Joker",               
  health: 75,
  insanity: 175,
  attack: attackFunc
}

```

Finally, let's make an attack. Notice how the superHero.strength isn't available for auto-complete. Let's just put it in there. The IDE is still showing us an error.

demo.ts

```typescript

superHero.attack(superVillian, superHero.strength);  // Object literal may only specify known 
                                                     // properties, and 'strength' does not exist 
                                                     // in type 'ComicBookCharacter'
```

Let's see what the compiler says. Object literal may only specify known properties, and strength does not exist on a ComicBookCharacter type. Neither does insanity.

Since we called the superhero attack function, we're seeing the error about strength again. We could add strength and insanity to the ComicBookCharacter interface.

However, we want to make sure that they're optional.

Otherwise, we need to add strength and insanity to both of our characters. But if we have to add every skill and power to the ComicBookCharacter interface, it's going to get pretty bloated.

Let's create an OptionalAttributes interface and "extend" the ComicBookCharacter interface with the optional attributes interface. Now when we run the compiler, we get no errors. When we run the code, nice.

demo.ts

```typescript

interface OptionalAttributes {
  strength?: number;
  insanity?: number;
  dexterity?: number;
  healingFactor?: number;
}

interface ComicBookCharacter extends OptionalAttributes { ... }

superHero.attack(superVillian, superHero.strength); // She-Hulk attacked Joker, who's health = -4925
                                                    // She-Hulk has no secret identity
```


So to review, interfaces describe the shape of a value but don't contain definitions. They can be set inline or as a type that can be referenced. Both options are useful.

Interfaces help with typos and errors. They can have optional parameters. They can be used to type other interface parameters or extend it.
