let userName: string = "Silver Surfer";
TypeScript gives us static types. When we run the compiler, there's no errors because the compiler knows that userName is a string. Typescript also gives us inference, which just means when there is no annotation the compiler will guess what type we want.

eggheadTypes/demo.ts

let userName = "Silver Surfer";
If we set a new value for userName, even though username has no annotation, both the IDE and the compiler are mad because the compiler inferred, or guessed, that userName is a string because it was initialized with a string. Array of strings is not assignable to type string.

eggheadTypes/demo.ts

let userName = "Silver Surfer";
userName = ["Silver", "Surfer"]; // error TS2322: type 'string[]' is 
                                 // not assignable to type 'string'.
We have to be careful. If we don't annotate userName, initialize it as undefined, and set a value later, like we've done here, when we run the compiler, we get no errors because the compiler can't infer what the type is.

eggheadTypes/demo.ts

```typescript
let userName;
userName = ["Silver", "Surfer"];
```
The compiler can also infer function return types. I'm just making a function that accepts a string and a number. Here's the return type. When we run the compiler, we get no errors. If we remove the annotation and run the compiler, again, no errors.

eggheadTypes/demo.ts

```typescript
let userId = (a: string, b:number): string => a + b;
```

If we annotate the return type with the wrong type, the compiler gets mad because we told it the return type is a number. It knows that a string plus a number is a string. That's not assignable to the number return type that we specified.

When we remove the return type and run the compiler no errors. This kind of inference happens from the bottom up. The compiler knows what the return type is, bottom, based on its arguments, top. There's also contextual inference, which is top down.

Let's say we have an HTMLElement and we want to use an onclick event and alert on that element. The compiler knows the type signature for the HTMLElement and its onclick method. When we run the compiler, there's no errors. If we remove the annotations and run the compiler, there's no errors.

eggheadTypes/demo.ts

```typescript
let target: HTMLElement = document.getElementById("target");
target.onclick = (event: MouseEvent) => event.button;
```

If we change the event handler argument type, the ID will show us that ironically, there is no Button parameter on an HTMLButtonElement. The compiler will tell us that we can't define the event handler's type as an HTML button, because it knows it should be a mouse event.

eggheadTypes/demo.ts

```typescript
let target: HTMLElement = document.getElementById("target");
target.onclick = (event: HTMLButtonElement) => event.button;  
// error TS2322: Type '(event: HTMLButtonElement) => any' is not assignable to type
// '(ev: MouseEvent) => any'.
// error TS2339: Property 'button' does not exist on type 'HTMLButtonElement'.
```

We've typed the argument passed through the function as an HTMLButtonElement. It's supposed to be a mouse event. We say that the HTMLButtonElement is incompatible with the event that's supposed to be passed, which is the mouse event. A button property does not exist on an HTMLButtonElement.

To review, contextual inference is top down. Top down. The compiler knows what the target is and its onclick method. It's guessing what the event handler argument type is based on the target onclick signature.

Vanilla inference is bottom up. The compiler is inferring what the function return type is based on its arguments. If you initialize your variables undefined, the compiler won't be able to infer what the type is.
