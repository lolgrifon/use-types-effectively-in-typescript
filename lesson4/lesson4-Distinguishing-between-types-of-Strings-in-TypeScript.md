Annotating a variable as a string type looks like this. Annotating a variable as a string literal type looks like this. The string Type variable can be set to any string, but the string literal Type can only be set to the type value, as well as null and undefined, as of now.

demo.ts

```typescript
let unit: string = "awesome";
let miles: "MILES" = "awesome";  // error TS2322: Type '"awesome"' is 
                            // not assignable to type '"Miles"'
```

When we set the string literal type to a value that is incorrect, the IDE will alert us, as well as the compiler. Type awesome is not assignable to type MILES. This string literal type by itself isn't that useful, but when combined with union types and alias types, they help document your code, catch errors, and large concepts can be boiled down to one alias.

To demonstrate, I'm going to make a function that accepts a number and a string. When I call the function, I can pass any number and any string. When we run the compiler, no errors. When we run the code, that's what I was going for.

demo.ts

```typescript
function moveCharacter(distance: number, value: string) {
  console.log(`You moved ${distance} ${value}`);
};

moveCharacter(3, "feet");   // You moved 3 feet
```

However, I can also pass the wrong string value. Run the compiler, no errors because I said any string. When we run the code, this is not what I was going for.

Instead, lets make a type alias using string literals and union types. N ow let's update our value argument to be a distance metric.

demo.ts

```typescript
type distanceMetric = "MILES" | "KILOMETERS" | "METERS" | "YARDS" | "FEET" | "INCHES";
function moveCharacter(distance: number, value: distanceMetric) {
  console.log(`You moved ${distance} ${value}`);  // error TS2345: Argument of type '"dragon"' is not 
                                                  // assignable to parameter of type '"MILES" | "KILOMETERS" | ... '
};
```

Already the IDE is alerting us that "dragon" is incorrect. If we run the compiler, it will say the same thing. '"Dragon"' is an unacceptable value for a type that can only be these values.

To review, string literal type values can only be set to its type, as well as null and undefined, for now. They're great for documenting your code, catching typos, and prevent assigning the wrong string. When combined with union types and alias types, string literals boil down large concepts to one alias.

For example, if our value requirement can only be specific string parameters, string literal types, union types, and alias types make that really easy.
